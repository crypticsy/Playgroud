# Dandi Biyo - Demo

A demo game built using Unity Game Engine, during my high school as a reminiscence of the childhood game I used to play with my cousins. </br></br>
Despite a lot of noticeable bugs, it's still a workable demo and can be used as a reference for creating a full-fledged game later on down the line.
