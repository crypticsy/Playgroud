A custom scrapper made to extract my group routines from the pdf provided by my college. 
[ In short, make my life easier. ðŸ˜œ ]

To use this:
 - Remane the pdf you want to use, to `data.pdf` as used in the repo.
 - Change the `mygroup` variable [at line 12] of main.py to your group name
   ( Example : mygroup = "N1" , currenlty the default is "C2")
 - Double click `run.bat` which will automatically run the python script.

The routine will be provided to you in `routine.txt` after executing `main.py`.
