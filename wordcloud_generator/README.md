# Wordcloud


Who doesn't like words pilled up together in a grid, where the size of each word represents the its frequency from a given database? Well it's not me for sure.

My curiosity over wordclouds led me to create one for "Friends",a series adored by the mass especially my classmates. However, the generator isn't limited to a certain series, just give it the subtitles and it can generate any according to your wish

#### Requirements

Type `pip install -r requirements.txt ` in your terminal.

Add the subtitles int the `data` folder. The default files is for friends. However, 
- Ensure that you only keep the required files, not files inside another folder or anything else
- Currently it is only configured to read `.srt` files and `.sub` files.

#### Generate Wordcloud

Just run the `main.py` file in your terminal. It's that simple.
